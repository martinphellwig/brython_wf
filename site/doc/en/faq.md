__Q__ : _what is the performance of Brython compared to Javascript, or to other solutions that allow using Python in the browser ?_

__R__ : compared to Javascript, the ratio is naturally very different from one program to another, but it is somewhere between 3 to 5 times slower. A Javascript console is provided in the distribution or on [the Brython site](http://brython.info/tests/js_console.html), it can be used to measure the execution time of a Javascript program compared to its equivalent in Python in the editor (unchecking the "debug" box)

The diffence is due to two factors :

- the time to translate Python into Javascript, on the fly in the browser. To give an idea, the module datetime (2130 lines of Python code) is parsed and converted to Javascript in 0,5 second on an ordinary PC
- JavaScript code generated by Brython must be compliant with the specifications of Python, including the dynamic nature of the search attributes, which leads to unoptimized Javascript code

Compared to other solutions that translate Python to Javascript, some [fanciful comparisons](http://pyppet.blogspot.fr/2013/11/brython-vs-pythonjs.html) mention a ratio of 1 to 7500 against Brython : no information is given, but it's obvious that they don't compare similar situations ; in the same conditions (running a script in a web browser) it's hard to imagine how to be faster than native Javascript...

Another factor is the coverage of the Python syntax supported by the solution. Those that only support a small subset of Python can produce code that runs faster ; Brython aims at covering 100% of the Python syntax, including an error reporting similar to CPython, even if this results in some cases in slower Javascript code

I haven't found serious comparisons between the solutions that can be found in [a list](http://stromberg.dnsalias.org/~strombrg/pybrowser/python-browser.html) maintained by Dan Stromberg. Nothing proves that the Javascript code generated by solutions written in Python are faster than the one generated by Brython. And the development cycle with solutions written in Python such as Pyjamas / pyjs is obviously longer than with Brython

__Q__ : _I see a lot of 404 errors in the browser console when I run Brython scripts, why is that ?_

__R__ : this is because of the way Brython implements the "import" mechanism. When a script has to import module X, Brython searches for a file or a package in different directories : the standard library (directory libs for Javascript modules, Lib for Python modules), the directory Lib/site-packages, the directory of current page. For that, Ajax calls are sent to the matching urls ; if the file is not found, the 404 error message is written in the browser console, but the error is caught by Brython which goes on searching until it finds the module, or raises `ImportError` if all paths have been tried with no result
