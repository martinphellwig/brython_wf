<h3>Interactive test</h3>

The Brythons site, or its mirror available for download, include a console where you can test Python code
<p>Please note that the namespace is not refreshed when you click on "run", you must reload the page for that
<p>For debugging and testing Brython, a number of test scripts are grouped in the directory <code>tests</code> ; you can access them by clicking the link  "Test pages" in the console, then select the different tests and run them

<h3>Debugging scripts</h3>

Whatever the debugging level, syntax errors are reported in the browser console (or at the place defined by <code>sys.stderr</code>)
<p>For instance, the code
<blockquote><pre>x = $a
</pre></blockquote>
<p>generates the message
<blockquote><pre>SyntaxError: unknown token [$]
module '__main__' line 1
x = $a
    ^
</pre></blockquote>

<p>By setting the debugging level to 1 in the call to function <code>brython(<i>debug_mode</i>)</code>, the exceptions raised at runtime and not caught by an <code>except</code> also produce an error message, as close as possible to the one generated by Python3
